== An experiment doing a sapce shooter with Crafty.js

Demo here[http://fierce-river-4788.herokuapp.com/].

It was originally bootstrapped using Rails for a future backend but I was bored and never really implemented any kind of backend neither finished the game.
All the code is in app/assets/javascripts[https://github.com/mickey/space_shooter/tree/master/app/assets/javascripts]. 
All is not used in the game but a lot have been implemented: different kind of enemys, squadrons of enemys, waves, levels, weapons,, ...
